# React Portfolio
For this assignment, we were tasked withÂ creating a portfolio using React that displays our information as well as websites we have worked on. We also had to update other aspects of our portfolio including our resume and Linkedin profile. 

## Difficulties
The main difficulty I had with this project was working with the CSS within React. I think with practice and further reading I will improve on styling.

## Overall thoughts
I preferred making my portfolio in basic HTML and CSS but I understand the ease of a React portfolio when it comes to updating certain subjects of the site.
